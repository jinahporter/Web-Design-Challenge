      <h3>Homework Description</h3>
      <br>
      <p>For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a
        past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

        In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate
        between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have
        a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the
        data used to build them.
